<p><b><i>Today, I am gonna start my diet and workouts.</i></b></p>
<p>You throw on that manly or sexy gym attire you’ve anticipated wearing for the last few months, hop into those nice Nike’s that have been collecting dust for you-can’t-even-remember-how-long, and walk straight to the gym with your, perhaps university-given, drawstring gym bag. Into that locker goes your stuff, and onto that rubber-padded floor goes you, where you proceed to…blank out.</p>
<p><i>What exactly am I supposed to do here? Hmm. This machine looks good for arms. Maybe I’ll get on the elliptical for a little. But wait, I want abs. Let me do some crunches. Damn. Look at that dude lifting all that weight. I am already hungry. Is Domino’s still delivering?</i></p>
<p>Yeah<b>. “This year, I am going to be healthy.”</b> That’s a new year’s resolution. I know I have made one like that before. Unfortunately, it is also one of the most failed resolutions many people make, regardless of the time of year it becomes a resolution. Whether you have been health-conscious for years or you are a novice to the world of personal fitness, you can feel the draw of fear and failure. I understand the feeling of not wanting to do that last rep on that last set of squats, or dreading chest and back supersets after six hours in the library. If you’re scared of embarrassing yourself in front of all the other dudes who curl fifty-pound dumbbells and bench 225, I know that feel bro. If you’re scared of what people think of your rather awkward running style, I have been there too. I think you get the general gist.</p>
<p>From my own experience, failure to reach <i>any</i> goal is usually caused by, in order of frequency:</p>
<ol>
<li>Lack of required effort</li>
<li>A misguided effort</li>
<li>Loss of interest</li>
<li>Fear of failure</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, what those factors are and the degrees to which they affect us do vary, but I think it’s pretty evident that, more often than not, our failures are a direct result of those four. And failure <i>almost certainly</i> comes from those when the resolution or goal at hand involves fitness. However, it is all but impossible to sledgehammer down that wall of failure.</p>
<p>Recently, I had a very intriguing catch-up conversation with an old friend of mine, <b><i>J</i></b>, who has in fact succeeded in not only bypassing failure, but also seemingly banishing the word from his fitness life. Bits of the conversation are of great interest to this post, so I have reproduced those excerpts below, yo:</p>
<p><b><i>J:</i></b><i> If you think about it, when you do get on your weight lifting grind, that regret you talk about will just get replaced by dissatisfaction. That&#8217;s why I love going to the gym. You’re never satisfied.</i><i> And improvements just sneak up on you lol.</i></p>
<p>…some words fly by…</p>
<p><b><i>Yours truly:</i></b><i> Nice man. A lot of people who start out working out aren&#8217;t consistent with it, or don&#8217;t track progress or success using any measure end up being dissatisfied like you said. But that dissatisfaction causes them to quit. Once you have made consistent progress, and you&#8217;re aware of that progress, that dissatisfaction ends up being your encouragement.</i></p>
<p><b><i>J: </i></b><i>Exactly, plus many are not informed about working out. Some think just go to the gym, and you get results. If you aren&#8217;t on point with your diet, then you’re just wasting your time.</i></p>
<p><b><i>Yours truly:</i></b><i> YES. Diet is like 90%.</i></p>
<p><b><i>J:</i></b><i> I used to be like that. Yeah, diet’s huge.</i></p>
<p>Our Facebook conversation was my inspiration for this post. So, after perhaps an unnecessarily large amount of thought and some analysis of my conversation with <i>J</i>, I present you with the twelve-fold path to the Zen of fitness success. Especially for my fellow college students. If you find yourself sauntering trepidatiously around the sea of fitness, this list may help you take that first dive. But I hope it helps you swim.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Diet ALWAYS comes before workouts. </b>You cannot out-exercise a bad diet. If a genie is going to grant you either a perfect diet or perfect workouts, you had better pick the diet. Don’t ignore the workouts, but understand that, as mentioned in my conversation with <i>J</i>, diet is 90% of fitness. Having a nice balance of both would be ideal, but when you can’t get to the gym (a.k.a <i>finals week</i>), you should try and make sure that at least your diet is consistent.</li>
<li><b>Know yourself.</b> More accurately, know your <i>strengths and weaknesses</i>. Focus on both, but more so on your weaknesses. Make them your strengths. You can run a marathon, but you can’t do a pull up? Focus on building strength in your back. Your diet is perfect, but maybe you’re too lazy to get to the gym? Focus on building up the discipline and desire to exercise.</li>
<li><b>Start off slowly, easily, and reasonably.</b> Trying to run six miles on your first day of cardio or attempting to squat four plates on your first leg day is like taking the final before you even know the name of the class. You’re not going to do well, and you will probably hurt yourself. Begin any fitness program by first testing the waters. Use lighter weight. Don’t run as fast. Ease into your diet. Use this rule in combination with #2. Move at your own pace at first, but push yourself once you’re comfortable with your body and your routine.</li>
<li><b>Know your schedule.</b> When is the best time for you to eat? When can you cook? When are you able to make it to the gym? Between my classes, extracurriculars, work, and relaxation or hanging out, I find myself best suited to cook on Sundays and Thursdays. I split my workouts into two separate sessions: cardio in the mornings and lifting in the evenings. That way, I spend less time in the gym, and can focus on each type of exercise. I eat breakfast at home, lunch on campus, and dinner/snacks at home. I hope you’re able to see how easy it is to figure this out.</li>
<li><b>The warm-up is almost as important as the workout. </b>Stretch. Do some warm-up sets. Run half a mile. The purpose of the warm-up is to get more blood to your muscles, activate your nervous system, and increase your heart rate a bit. Once you have accomplished those three things, and you have stretched, you are ready to begin your workout.</li>
<li><b>Do the exercises you want to do.</b> <b>At first.</b> To build your interest in working out, do the exercises YOU like for each body part or muscle group. This will also make you more likely to get familiar with your body. Moreover, if you are just starting out, avoid moves like the lunge-curl-press and hanging leg raises into hanging levers. Try simpler compound moves, and basic cardio forms before moving on to harder ones. Master the push up before you try the bench press. Master the squat and lunge before you try Romanian deadlifts or Bulgarian split-squats. <b>The same can be said for diet</b>. Eat the healthy things that you want to eat first. Then try the fun stuff (quinoa, Greek yogurt, agave nectar, tempeh).</li>
<li><b>Go to sleep.</b> Rest (along with diet, obviously) is often more important than the exercise. Sleep gives your body a chance to recover, reset, re-energize, et cetera. <b>Sleep is also the one things almost all college students consistently lose.</b> Time management definitely comes into play here, so try and get consistent sleep. Wake up at the same time. Sleep at the same time.</li>
<li><b>Set reasonable goals, and reach them. </b>This is something I consistently failed at. I used to set very unreasonable goals, and then sip on a nice martini of failure causes 1, 2, 3, &amp; 4 as listed at the beginning of this post. It took a while before I understood why I wasn’t reaching my goals. Of course! Losing forty pounds in one month is <i>very </i>possible! You just have to cut off your leg! But really now. Understand your personal limits and push them. Just don’t swan dive over them. And use an appropriate way to measure your progress. The most common way to do this is to step on a scale, a tool almost all gyms have. BMI is another decent one. I use a mixture of a scale and body fat percentage; when you try to “bulk” it gets a little more complicated and the value of a tool like BMI drastically drops.</li>
<li><b>Patience is a virtue. </b>A drastic change in your body will happen slowly. Usually, the truly noticeable changes will be visible after circa six weeks. <i>Do not</i> get discouraged if you haven’t lost ten pounds in week one. They will come off in time, and simply dash your eyes up to #8 on this list. If you have already given up a few times, and intend on starting up a healthy lifestyle again, this rule may be your one-way ticket to fitness paradise. Conversely, if you are waiting too long for a change, reassess your habits. Can you cut out a few extra carbs or calories? Are your exercises effective or workouts intense enough? Is your sleep cycle consistent?</li>
<li><b>Don’t sacrifice form for your ego. Trust me.</b> If there is one thing I have most definitely learned the hard way, this is it. Prolapsed discs in <i>both</i> my sacral and lumbar vertebrae, resulting in sciatica (even as I write this). Torn ACL and slightly torn MCL. Rotator cuff problems. Tennis elbow. Rolled ankles. Yeah, that’s why you may see me walking around like Frankenstein. Return of the Mummy. Anyway, squatting a lot doesn’t mean anything if you can’t make your thighs parallel to the ground with that weight. Bench-pressing 405 pounds doesn’t really mean much if you cant do a full rep. The use of proper form and appropriate resistance or intensity is what will really get you results while your protecting you from injury.</li>
<li><b>Alcohol, tobacco, etc. are drugs. </b>Do not forget this. It is best to abstain for the most part, but if you choose to indulge, understand that it will set you back <i>a lot</i> and can cause some major health issues down the road. More than likely when Natty Light, Burnett’s, and Marlboro No. 27s aren’t as cool to you anymore.</li>
<li><b>Pretend the other people in the gym do not exist.</b> Besides where gym etiquette is appropriate. Focus on you, your workout, and your music. The gym is a terrible place to be social, unless you’re there with a partner who is as focused on his or her workout as you should be. Keep the focus and intensity in the gym high, and the time as low as possible. It’s hard to maintain two-hour workouts every-effing-day of the week as a working adult, let alone a college student (who may also be working on top of that).</li>
</ol>
<p>And there you have it. If I missed a few, there’s a comment section below. You can embarrass me there. Nevertheless, I stand my ground with the twelve I listed above being most important for those in college. With some hard work, discipline, and a relentless fortitude of mind, we can remain fitness-oriented in our academic careers and secure guiding principles for our personal health and wellness for years to come.</p>
