            <h2>So much to do, So little time&#8230;</h2>
<p>When you&#8217;re self employed and run several projects, like to play lots of computer games, want to work out regularly and have family &amp; social commitments, there are never enough hours in the day. I&#8217;ve always joked to myself that I needed a 40 hour day to get it all done.</p>
<p>Everybody has the same 24 hours in any given day but it&#8217;s what we do with them that makes the difference. Unfortunately most people, myself included, tend to spend about a third of those hours sleeping. This is something which I have always considered a huge waste of time.</p>
<p>I first heard about the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphasic_sleep">Polyphasic sleep</a> around 10 years ago when Steve Pavlina <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/10/polyphasic-sleep/">posted about it</a> on his blog and decided to try it out. I followed his experiment with interest and was fascinated by the idea of having so many extra waking hours in the day.</p>
<h2>Poly-what?</h2>
<p>In case you&#8217;re not familiar with the concept, most people sleep monophasically which is in a single block of sleep in a 24 hour period. Polyphasic sleeping is adopting a schedule where sleep is taken in multiple blocks during that 24 hour period, but the total sleep time is usually reduced, sometimes drastically so.</p>
<p>There are a multitude of schedules and they vary greatly. The one which Steve did is called &#8216;Uberman&#8217; and is a very strict schedule of 6 x 20 minute naps evenly spaced every 3 hours 40 minutes. This results in a total of just 2 hours sleep per day!</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m not going to go into all the reasons why Polyphasic sleep can work as this has been covered in depth already by other people such as <a href="http://www.puredoxyk.com/">Puredoxyk</a> who has been Polyphasic for many years, has written a book on it, and was actually the person who named the Uberman schedule.</p>
<h2>My First Attempt</h2>
<p>After reading Steve&#8217;s blog I wanted to try it for myself but there was one rather large problem. I was employed in a day job as a software developer and I worked fairly standard 9-5ish hours most of the time. Though I did have a 1 hour lunch break.</p>
<p>I tried napping in the car and having another nap as soon as I got home from work. Neither of these worked and I gave up after a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>I then forgot all about Polyphasic sleeping, which is a shame as I quit that job in 2007 and have worked from home being self employed ever since so my time is my own now.</p>
<h2>An Accidental Polyphasic Period</h2>
<p>Around 3 weeks ago I was having a really crappy day. I can&#8217;t even remember why right now but at one point I was so fed up that I actually just went to bed and curled up for a bit! To my surprise, I fell asleep. Normally I don&#8217;t sleep well during the day.</p>
<p>A few hours later I was still feeling crappy and I went to bed again and fell asleep again. That night, due to those two naps I wasn&#8217;t tired and I ended up staying up really late. But the next morning I still woke up pretty early as normal but was feeling very tired as I really hadn&#8217;t had many hours sleep during the night.</p>
<p>I decided to take another couple of naps in the day to get through the day when I got tired and once again I had a late night and early morning. It was then that I suddenly remembered Polyphasic sleep!</p>
<p>I decided to Google it to see if there was any new information about it as it was virtually unheard of 10 years prior. There was a LOT more information about it now and so I read up for a while and decided to do it properly, well sort of.</p>
<h2>My usual sleeping habits</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve never been a very good sleeper. It can take me a while to get to sleep, I sometimes wake up several times during the night and often feel very groggy in the morning when I wake up. The idea of sleeping an entire 8 uninterrupted hours followed by leaping out of bed full of vitality is a completely unknown concept for me.</p>
<p>I usually go to bed around midnight -1am and get up anywhere from 7-9am. I don&#8217;t usually use an alarm. One of the benefits of working for yourself is that you can do what you like :-) Actually, I had been using an alarm recently as during the winter I can sleep in much longer and I hate being so unproductive so I have been setting one for the mornings but even then I&#8217;d often snooze it multiple times before actually dragging myself out of bed so it doesn&#8217;t really help.</p>
<p>I decided to continue taking a single nap in the day time but figured I could sleep less at night to make up for it. 6 hours seemed good so I decided to set an alarm for 6am and go to bed around midnight as usual.</p>
<p>Ugh 6am starts! It&#8217;s extremely cold and dark at 6am here in the UK. Not nice at all. I did this for almost a week and didn&#8217;t enjoy it at all. Even though I was actually able to sleep at nap times which surprised me, I didn&#8217;t really feel any less tired during the day and I wasn&#8217;t really saving many sleep hours. Perhaps I was gaining 60-90 minutes a day.</p>
<h2>Doing it Properly</h2>
<p>At this point, I felt as though I had been constantly tired for a week and had nothing to show for it. I decided to buy Puredoxyk&#8217;s Book and to do this properly. I learned about all the different sleep schedules and the one that seemed most appealing was Everyman 3 which is a 3 hour core sleep with 3 x 20 minute naps.</p>
<p>However, it also seemed a little extreme for me and the idea of sleeping just 3 hours a night was too much of a jump for me at the time. So I fugured that seeing as I had already spent a week doing 6 hours +1 nap, I figured I could do a 3-phased approach:</p>
<ol>
<li>6 hour core sleep + 1 nap (already done)</li>
<li>4.5 hour core sleep + 2 naps</li>
<li>3 hour core sleep + 3 naps</li>
</ol>
<p>As I had already done the first phase I was excited to move into phase 2. I found a handy online tool called <a href="http://napchart.com/">Napchart</a> which allows you to visually create your sleep schedule with ease. This is what my schedule looked like on phase 2:</p>
<div id="attachment_465" style="width: 555px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-465" src="http://www.caroline-middlebrook.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/phase2_1stversion.png" alt="Polyphasic Everyman 4.5 Schedule" width="545" height="509" srcset="http://www.caroline-middlebrook.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/phase2_1stversion-300x280.png 300w, http://www.caroline-middlebrook.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/phase2_1stversion.png 545w" sizes="(max-width: 545px) 100vw, 545px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">4.5 hour core sleep + 2 x 20 minute naps, spaced evenly</p></div>
<p>I live in the UK and right now it&#8217;s not getting light in the morning until about 7.30am. I&#8217;ve always been a bit sensitive to darkness (I love sunshine, and can feel pretty depressed on really dark days) and I found that getting up at 4.30am just felt so&#8230; wrong.</p>
<h2>It&#8217;s so&#8230; DARK!</h2>
<p>I spent the first few hours of the day wrapped in my dressing gown in my office with a tiny crack in my curtains looking for signs of life from my neighbours. It felt so lonely! I mean, I work alone anyway and have done now for 8 eight years and I typically don&#8217;t get lonely but this was horrible and I just hated it.</p>
<p>However, at night time, if I&#8217;m staying up late the darkness doesn&#8217;t bother me one bit. So after a few days I decided to shift things around a bit so that I was waking up closer to daylight. I didn&#8217;t want to have to nap during the evenings as that&#8217;s when I&#8217;m usually busy doing social things so I decided to add in a third nap to prepare myself for phase 3 but still keep the 4.5 hour core for now:</p>
<div id="attachment_466" style="width: 533px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-466" src="http://www.caroline-middlebrook.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/phase2_2ndversion.png" alt="Polyphasic sleep schedule Everyman 4.5" width="523" height="509" srcset="http://www.caroline-middlebrook.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/phase2_2ndversion-300x292.png 300w, http://www.caroline-middlebrook.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/phase2_2ndversion.png 523w" sizes="(max-width: 523px) 100vw, 523px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">4.5 hour core sleep, waking up closer to daylight, plus 3 naps</p></div>
<p>At this point I had been doing Polyphasic for around 2 weeks. I found this version much better in terms of getting up at 6.30am. This felt like a far more normal time to get up and by the time I had done the usual morning things like clean teeth, make coffee, feed cat etc and sat at the computer it wasn&#8217;t long before the sun started to come up. Psychologically, this worked much better for me.</p>
<p>As you can see, that third nap is not timed well. Ideally it would be much earlier and all 3 would be earlier to space them more evenly but as I said, I really need to keep my evening free.</p>
<h2>Sleep Deprivation Symptoms</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve not actually mentioned the tiredness effects yet. Into the second week, I was starting to feel it more. One thing that seemed strange to me was that the absolute worst time was the hours following my core sleep. Then during the day I would in general feel better and better each after each nap. I would have assumed that I would have felt at my best after sleeping for several hours and then would get more tired as the day grew on. Nope &#8211; the opposite!</p>
<p>This really threw me off because in general, I have always been someone who is most productive in the morning. I always work on my most difficult projects first and leave easier work until the afternoons. In the evenings I usually like to chill out and if I&#8217;m not seeing my other half, family etc then I&#8217;d generally be playing computer games until bed time.</p>
<p>Try as I might to be productive in the morning, the sleep deprivation was kicking in and actually seemed to get worse and not better. I had to start switching things around and working through the evenings to catch up from unproductive morning times.</p>
<p>After about a week of this I started to feel quite frustrated, and I decided that I may as well just move to the final phase which is just a 3 hour core and the three naps. This is the most common polyphasic sleep schedule of this kind (with a core sleep) and is known as the Everyman 3 schedule.</p>
<p>Many people were doing this as their lifestyle and it provided a total of 4 hours sleep which is approximately half what I would get on a normal monophasic routine. I didn&#8217;t need to change things much, I just basically went to bed a bit later and tweaked the nap times slightly:</p>
<div id="attachment_467" style="width: 527px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-467" src="http://www.caroline-middlebrook.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Everyman3.png" alt="Everyman 3 polyphasic sleep schedule" width="517" height="700" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The Everyman 3 Schedule &#8211; 3 hour core + 3 naps</p></div>
<p>This is where things started to get <em>really</em> tough. I remember the first night staying up to 3.30am. This part was quite fun as I just played games for longer but trying to get up in the morning &#8211; oh my God!</p>
<p>I can see where the term being like a zombie comes from. I couldn&#8217;t keep my eyes open and what was really strange is that I had this incredibly uncomfortable sensation in my muscles &#8211; legs in particular that made me unable to relax and feel as though I needed to stretch them constantly.</p>
<p>I could not keep my body still, I was <em>constantly</em> twitching, contracting and stretching to try and relieve this horrible feeling and all the while that was going on my eyes just would keep dropping. I found myself pacing around the house really shuffling like a zombie because my legs wouldn&#8217;t move properly and my eyes were closed!</p>
<p>This was one of the most uncomfortable feelings I have ever experienced! The desire to just curl up and sleep was so great but I wanted to do this really badly so I powered through.</p>
<p>The duration of this discomfort varied. The first couple of days it would last maybe an hour or so and then it would pass and then I&#8217;d just be left with regular tiredness. This did not make me have to keep squirming constantly but I was still extremely foggy headed and my work was really suffering.</p>
<p>According to the book, these narcolepsy type symptoms are where the true adaptation occurs. The body needs sleep so badly that when you nap, it begins to drop straight into REM sleep in order to get the rest that it needs. When that happens, it begins to get easier.</p>
<p>However, this wasn&#8217;t happening. I found that these acute symptoms became longer and occurred more frequently. Even the first nap wasn&#8217;t helping &#8211; they started to creep in the afternoons as well. My whole day was starting to feel like torture. And waking up from every single nap was becoming like the core sleep &#8211; so difficult to wake up from.</p>
<h2>Time to Quit (For now)</h2>
<p>I have a minor surgery booked in a couple of weeks just a few days before Christmas. Recovering from surgery is not a time for sleep deprivation. I was hoping I could adapt to this schedule before the surgery, then rest as needed for a few days and then be able to quickly get back into the Polyphasic schedule. It&#8217;s becoming clear that this isn&#8217;t going to happen.</p>
<p>Today, I decided to quit. I&#8217;ve been reading a fair bit of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/polyphasic/">Polyphasic Reddit</a> and it seems quite a few people are having more success with a more <a href="http://www.hacktheeveryday.com/">gradual adaptation</a> over a period of several months rather than trying to dive straight into it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m at the point where despite being awake for 20 hours a day, I&#8217;m productive for maybe 6 of those hours only. If I was clearly showing signs of adapting and knew that it would only last a few days I would tough it out but that doesn&#8217;t seem to be happening and knowing that I have to abandon it anyway in just over 2 weeks for the surgery has made the decision for me.</p>
<p>This morning, I went to sleep at 11.30 but I didn&#8217;t set my alarm. I woke up 4 hours later with the cat curled up next to me :-) Then I wrote this blog post in a flurry of activity! How nice it is to feel awake!</p>
<h2>My Plan for the New Year</h2>
<p>The idea of having an extra 4 hours every day is so appealing that I really want to try and make this work for me. So, I shall try again in the New Year but do it differently.</p>
<p>My plan is to begin by sleeping normally and then adding in naps to my routine and very gradually reducing the length of the core sleep over time. These last couple of weeks have been a blur and I didn&#8217;t keep any logs. This post is written from my somewhat foggy memory. When I start again, I&#8217;m going to document it here on this blog for my own purposes and for anyone who is interested.</p>

		<p>Hi Caroline great post weird but wonderful 😎 I remember Tim Ferris on about polyphasic sleep, so after this very informative honest post I am going to give this a try. We have some big projects coming up and the extra hours will be great. I think the gradual adaptation sounds interesting as I already have one or 2 power naps of @ 10 minutes each day. So idea is to increase these and reduce core sleep.</p>
<p>Good luck with the surgery and merry Xmas keep blogging 😀</p>
<p>Paul</p>

		<p>Hi Paul. I have Tims 4 Hour Body book and also re-read the section on Polyphasic a week or two ago but it was quite sparse on information. Puredoxyk seems to have the most information available that I&#8217;ve seen and her book is extremely good though she recommends a sudden switch to the chosen schedule and just sucking up the sleep deprivation symptoms! Let me know how you get along with it :-)</p>

		<p>I have heard that every hour of sleep you get before midnight is worth 2 hours of sleep you get after midnight. It&#8217;s something to do with the chemicals that are released during the early hours of the morning, I think. Also, being on a computer before bedtime will disrupt your sleep. You&#8217;re looking at a light source, which tricks your brain into thinking it&#8217;s still daylight. See what happens if you turn that computer off a few hours earlier and read in low lighting, and see if you can still stay awake until gone midnight. I bet you won&#8217;t be able to.</p>
<p>Personally, I like going to bed early and getting up early. I don&#8217;t like staying up late. I tend to go to bed about 9:00-9:30, read for a bit before sleep, and then get up at 6:00 am. But I like to meditate once or twice during the day, too. </p>
<p>Many years ago, people used to got to bed when it was dark but get up for a few hours in the night and then go back to bed again later in the night. </p>
<p>But I think you discovered something interesting here. In 20 hours, you were only productive for 6 of those. I don&#8217;t think we need to be productive for 16 hours a day, never mind 20. I think we need to balance productivity with relaxation, and sleep is a big part of that. Don&#8217;t forget, sleep is not wasted time. A lot goes on both physically and mentally to repair after a day&#8217;s activity. The body repairs tissues during deep sleep, and during dreaming sleep your mind plays through everything that has happened that day and everything you are worried might happen tomorrow. This is important, and not wasted time. </p>
<p>I would say it&#8217;s a good job you do work from home rather than commute because I seem to remember hearing that many of the accidents that happen on our roads happen to people who have slept 6 hours or less. </p>
<p>I would also say that the best modification you can make to your sleep schedule is to switch that computer off earlier and go to bed earlier, but that&#8217;s just my opinion.</p>
<p>All the best,<br />
Marcus</p>
