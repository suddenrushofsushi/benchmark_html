				<p>Flavon has won the coveted Monde Selection Award this year for Protect. Their Max Plus won in 2012. This is the top award given to health products in Europe; more than 3000 products from 90 countries compete. All Flavon products use only raw, unheated, biologically sun ripe fruit and vegetables that are constantly checked for the cleanest and purest ingredients and the safest processing.</p>
<p>Consider how we shower the outside of our bodies to keep them clean and healthy. Taking Flavon enables us to scrub the inside of our bodies where toxins, parasites, and bad bacteria accumulate. The flavonoids, which are so concentrated in these products, literally grab toxins and cancers and eliminate them from our bodies.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.barbarahattemer.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/post-22.jpg" rel="shadowbox[sbpost-255];player=img;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-262" src="http://blog.barbarahattemer.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/post-22.jpg" alt="Flavon Green Plus" width="650" height="174" /></a></p>
<p>NEW FLAVON PRODUCT being released November 1: GREEN PLUS with the HIGHEST ORAC on the World Market. It will contain:</p>
<ol>
<li>ARTICHOKES</li>
<li>BETA-GLUKAN (Special MUSHROOM with Yeast, special CANCER-KILLER and for CANCER PREVENTION)</li>
<li>CITRUS PEKTIN</li>
<li>TURMERIC</li>
<li>ORANGE OIL</li>
<li>MORINGA</li>
<li>ASPARAGUS</li>
<li>BROCCOLI</li>
<li>SEA BUCKTHORN</li>
<li>GREEN TEA</li>
<li>CARROTS</li>
<li>SPIRULINA</li>
<li>SPINACH</li>
</ol>
<p>Just one of these ingredients, SEA BUCKTHORN, called a &#8220;nutrient bomb,&#8221; contains more than 200 bioactive compounds. It nourishes and regenerates mucous membranes which cover the digestive, respiratory and uro-genital tracts and inner surface of the eyes. They are the major routes for pathogens, toxins and allergens to enter the body. Mucous membranes are often attacked by diseases, stress, aging and side effects of medication. Sea buckthorn also regenerates uro-genital mucous membranes, maintains the health of stomach and intestines, cures gastric ulcers, increases the level of good cholesterol in the blood and relieves dry mouth symptoms. <span style="font-size: 10pt;">1</span></p>
<p>I don’t want to overwhelm you with the benefits of each of these ingredients, but, believe me, this is a powerhouse of health generating products. Personally, I can’t wait to order GREEN PLUS.</p>
<p>I promised you TESTIMONIALS  from people using the product in this country. Here is the report from D. Todd Wylie, OD, FCOVD in Spokane, WA:</p>
<blockquote><p>#1  Massage therapist with very mild macular degeneration started Flavon and after 1 month reported that he had just had his blood anti oxidant levels measured and he said they were incredibly high.</p>
<p>#2  Later that day a 41 year old patient who had been using Flavon for two months reported he had all 4 wisdom teeth removed. Two of them were impacted and had to be broken from his jaw bone. When the oral surgeon saw him for his next visit, he said the patient was healing at the speed of a 17 year old.</p>
<p>#3  An 89 year old sweet lady who is nutrition conscious with advanced macular degeneration came in after using Flavon for 2 weeks. She is very pleased by the energy and well being she is experiencing since beginning the Flavon. She said, &#8220;I feel like I am in my 40&#8217;s again!&#8221;</p>
<p>#4  A close friend of ours was visiting us last weekend. She is a 54 year old nurse. She has been suffering for years with shoulder pain. She has tried a number of therapies without significant relief. She reported that she pretty much wakes hourly due to the discomfort and pain. She left our house Tuesday morning with Flavon. She has been doing 1 spoon Protect and 2 spoons Greens. Last night (Friday) my wife received a call from Kathleen and she is ecstatic because for the last two nights she has gone to bed at 10 pm and has not woken up until 4 am. She mentioned her fingers are no longer tingling when she wakes up.<br />
(As a side note, she is now the third person to report significantly reduced shoulder pain.) I have had two patients who each had 15 year old shoulder pain. They had resigned themselves to the fact that they would have that pain for the rest of their lives. They were both absolutely amazed as within two weeks of beginning Flavon their shoulder pain was basically gone!</p>
<p>#5  I have had 3 patients report profound reduction in photophobia (sensitivity to bright light).The first patient is 83 years old and is very vibrant and full of life. She is very much into nutrition and health care. After two weeks of Flavon she came into the office to tell me how excited she was.  For 20+ years she has needed to immediately put on sunglasses when going out into the sunlight. Now she can go out in the sunlight without any light sensitivity.  It very likely is increasing the speed of the photo chemical refresh rate in the light receptors of the retina.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am the mother of a 6 year-old Autistic boy. My son is a &#8216;picky eater&#8217; and it is very difficult to have him consume fruits and veggies on a daily basis.  I was encouraged to have him try Flavon Protect.  Well, my son LOVES IT.  Not only does he get the benefits of the nutrients, but I can add a holistic protocol and hide it in the jelly for him to take.  We are so THANKFUL for this product.  We just ordered the green veggie and remain prayerful that our little guy will like this as well.” &#8211; Linda G.</p>
<p>&#8220;Using Flavon products has been a very positive experience for me, I noticed improvement in my eyesight within weeks, dry eyes have gone away, I no longer use eyedrops and I have found my ability to focus while reading has greatly improved. I am now experiencing a deeper sleep and waking up fully refreshed. at 2:00 in the afternoon I no longer feel rundown. Sugar cravings and the desire for sweets is all but gone! There are many more things I have experienced, the best way to describe it overall. I feel better!” &#8211; Sean C.</p></blockquote>
<p>I could give you many more and can add my own. I can play tennis longer. I sleep better and require fewer naps. A problem I have had since I had polio in 1957 has completely cleared up and has greatly enhanced my life. I am so excited about FLAVON and want everyone to know about its many benefits. If you are interested, please call me at 239-594-7754.</p>
