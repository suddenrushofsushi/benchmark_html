		<p>I&#8217;m so bad at breakups. I feel SO BAD and avoid it and cry and altogether hate the process. This applies even if I&#8217;m &#8220;breaking up&#8221; with a company.</p>
<p>Today, I cancelled my debit card and DIDN&#8217;T CRY! I&#8217;m so proud of myself. Here&#8217;s the deal: I didn&#8217;t pick this debit card in the first place. It was the refund option the University gave me back when I was a wee little freshman. There were no fees as long as you were a student, and I got my money right away. Cool beans, worked for 18 year old me. After that, I didn&#8217;t see a reason to change it.</p>
<p>Until now. I&#8217;ll graduate in a couple months (!!!) and I don&#8217;t NEED a debit card. I haven&#8217;t used it in months &#8211; preferring always to use my cash back credit card &#8211; and I do have a debit card with my credit union if something goes terribly wrong. So, adios, debit card!</p>
<p>If I could do it all over again, I probably wouldn&#8217;t ever get that card. It was alright, I guess, but I would recommend just having the money deposited in a normal checking account so that it all stays in one place.</p>
<p>I would also tell my 18 year old self to get a credit card ASAP. My personal preference is to always make sure it has some kind of benefit. My first card had a deposit (it kind of sucked), but I still got cash back. It was a great way to build up a year&#8217;s worth of credit history&#8230; but that card also had a fee, so I cancelled it after year 1. I then switched to the Amazon card &#8211; no fee, 3% cash back on Amazon purchases&#8230; it works great for me. I&#8217;d like to get the Bank of America Travel Rewards Card, but that&#8217;ll probably come later (like, once I have a job).</p>
<p>My biggest piece of advice to anyone getting a credit card is to DO YOUR RESEARCH. Seriously, there are so many options now and they all have different benefits or disadvantages. Figure out what YOU want, how you&#8217;ll use the card, and do some math &#8211; will you spend enough to capitalize on the perks the card advertises? If so, check your credit score and go for it.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve tried doing monthly favorites. It just doesn&#8217;t work for me. I&#8217;m SO BAD about doing the whole photo collage and honestly, by the time the end of the month rolls around, I&#8217;ve forgotten what I&#8217;ve liked all month.</p>
<p>Instead I&#8217;m going to try random posts with just a few things that I love RIGHT NOW. I might even do these weekly or something because I love a lot of things and like sharing. Ready? Here we go.</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. my mom&#8217;s chicken enchiladas. I used to say that shredded chicken tacos were my fave food ever, and they kind of still are&#8230; but I also really like enchiladas, and the chicken is the same&#8230; and I kind of like them better as enchiladas (how many times can I say the word enchiladas in one post? LOTS OF TIMES). I&#8217;ll do a recipe post on it soon because they&#8217;re pretty easy but also kind of complicated. It&#8217;s a process at least, so I&#8217;ll share it later on. Seriously though, I could eat these all the time.</p>
<p>2. <a href="http://jamieivey.com/category/podcast-2" target="_blank">The Happy Hour with Jamie Ivey</a> (podcast). YOU GUYS. I&#8217;d heard about this podcast before but it&#8217;s a Christian podcast and I&#8217;m not super religious&#8230; anyway, Emily from<a href="http://jonesdesigncompany.com" target="_blank"> Jones Design Company</a> was on two episodes and so I went and listened&#8230; and now I&#8217;m HOOKED. The podcast is so good that I sent a text to my Little this morning telling her she HAD to go and listen. It&#8217;s so much like listening to a couple of your best girlfriends chat (and not being able to say anything, but trust me, you&#8217;ll wish you could call these ladies up and gab for a while). It&#8217;s not in-your-face with religion, but it&#8217;s JUST ENOUGH to inspire you to be better about life. I have a few girlfriends in real life that I talk Jesus with sometimes and it&#8217;s perfect and fun and I always leave feeling so happy&#8230; this is just like that. Jamie brings on different ladies every week (two weeks? I&#8217;m listening to old episodes right now so I&#8217;m not sure what the current schedule is) and it&#8217;s just FUN.</p>
<p>3. watercolors. I&#8217;m seriously like a five year old with my creative habits&#8230; basically my life is like, oh let&#8217;s do THIS craft and then THIS craft and those aren&#8217;t done yet but let&#8217;s start THIS ONE TOO. I&#8217;m sure my parents love it. (Not.) Anyway, I&#8217;ve been trying to figure out watercolors for some time now because they look so good when artsy people do them&#8230; and mine look terrible. TURNS OUT there are actual rules you should follow&#8230; like using watercolor paper. It&#8217;s a DUH thing but I didn&#8217;t. I tried to use printer paper and just no. It doesn&#8217;t work. It works OKAY on the greeting cards I make (that&#8217;s another post I plan to put up at some point&#8230;) but seriously, watercolor paper is so much better. I&#8217;ve read that the 140 lb paper is the best but it&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve used at this point so I don&#8217;t have any comparison.</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I read somewhere that ALL blog posts should have an image (because otherwise, you can&#8217;t link them to pinterest!), but I&#8217;m realllllly new at Illustrator, so this one is going to be imageless for a while. Maybe I&#8217;ll come back and add something in once I finish Emily&#8217;s class on Illustrator (which will prob be in my next &#8220;love&#8221; post).</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>A question that has haunted me recently is the famous (or perhaps, <em>infamous</em>) &#8220;where do you see yourself in five years?&#8221; As a kid, I could tell you exactly what I planned to do, right down to the college I wanted to go to (which ironically was TAMUCC, my current university, so while I ended up at my childhood dream uni, it wasn&#8217;t my <em>teenage </em>dream university. Sigh). I threw everything out of whack when I decided to go to a middle school out of my district, which led to going to a high school also out of my district. I&#8217;m pretty sure that my answer to the five-year question was a safe bet &#8211; five years past high school would either have me in college or grad school (which, you know, is accurate).</p>
<p>The past few years have been the tricky part, and it&#8217;s only gotten harder as I&#8217;ve gotten closer to the end of education. I&#8217;m not sure where I&#8217;ll be in five years. I honestly have <em>no clue </em>where I&#8217;ll be. I&#8217;m fairly certain that I won&#8217;t still live with my parents (something I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;re all grateful for), but I can&#8217;t say with even a grain of certainty at which city &#8211; or state &#8211; I&#8217;ll be in. I do know that I&#8217;ll be 27, but I&#8217;m currently single&#8230; is five years enough for me to meet someone and fall in love? Maybe, but maybe not. Will I have my dream job by then? Is it even possible to move up the ranks that fast? Will my dream job <em>now </em>even be my dream job once I try it out?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve proven time and time again that I can&#8217;t predict the future. I can&#8217;t &#8211; and don&#8217;t want to &#8211; set deadlines and limits for myself. Where do I see myself in five years? I don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t set goals, or have dreams, or aspire to be or do something. It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t <em>want </em>to do things with my life, and it&#8217;s certainly not that I don&#8217;t work towards those things. I just don&#8217;t look towards the future and decide that a certain accomplishment will happen by a certain time.</p>
<p>Sure, I have age goals. I want to have a book published by the time I&#8217;m 30. An old boyfriend got me hooked on the idea of visiting all 50 states by the time I&#8217;m 30. (Thirty&#8217;s going to be a big year!) I&#8217;d like to retire (from a corporate life) early and spend my time doing things I love &#8211; even if those things involve working. I want to be financially sound as early as possible &#8211; 27 would be great! Is that realistic? We&#8217;ll see, but I&#8217;m not going to set myself up for failure by saying that I want it within five years.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s important to have goals and dreams, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s necessary to set definite limits and predict where you&#8217;ll be in a certain number of years. I live my life by the motto that everything happens for a reason, and if it&#8217;s meant to be, it will find a way. So many things in my life have happened because I was in the right place at the right time, and had the qualifications to jump at the opportunity. I didn&#8217;t plan to go to the middle school I chose. I didn&#8217;t plan to join BPA (Business Professionals of America) or fall in love with accounting. I didn&#8217;t plan to work during college, yet I loved the job at Harte that almost literally fell into my lap. To be fair, I didn&#8217;t even plan to go to grad school&#8230; it just happened because my grades were good and I needed extra credits before sitting for the CPA exam and I didn&#8217;t want to get a real job.</p>
<p>Maybe in five years, I&#8217;ll be living on the beach somewhere (says the girl who already lives in a sort-of beach town&#8230;). Maybe I&#8217;ll be living in a big city. Maybe I&#8217;ll have gotten started in real estate. Maybe I&#8217;ll be making art. Maybe I&#8217;ll have things figured out.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fun to dream about five years from now, but thinking about it too seriously stresses me out big time. I&#8217;m just going to let it happen as it wants, and figure things out as they come.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.courtneycstevens.com/novels/"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1191" src="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/faking-normal-hc-official-cover1.jpg?w=640&#038;h=967" alt="Faking-Normal-HC-official-cover"   /></a></p>
<p>I picked FAKING NORMAL up at a Barnes &amp; Noble in Chicago. I kept picking it up, reading a random bit, putting it down&#8230; and then being drawn back to the book to pick it up again. That&#8217;s how I pick books &#8211; either by the cover (of course I judge books by their covers&#8230; that&#8217;s what they&#8217;re for), or by reading either the first few lines or some random page. If I want to know more, I buy it. It&#8217;s only failed me once or twice in all my book buying years.</p>
<p>Anyway, FAKING NORMAL was captivating, not in a &#8220;this book is so suspenseful&#8221; way (or, not in the bookstore, at least), but in the &#8220;I seriously cannot stop reading this book&#8221;. It came home with me. I started reading it on the airplane, and let me tell you, there&#8217;s a serious tissue warning for this book. You should be able to gather that from the back of the book or from the first few pages (it starts at a funeral, come on), so that&#8217;s not a spoiler. If anything, it&#8217;s an incentive to read the book.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a beautiful book. It deals with loss and heartache, with friendship and romance. It deals with growing up and not knowing how to act or think or <em>be. </em>It deals with strange habits and coping methods. It deals with healing.</p>
<p>I love it. I&#8217;m going to put together a list of my favorite books of all time &#8211; that&#8217;ll be out sometime soon &#8211; and this one is on it, for sure. I don&#8217;t even have to think about that. I literally started the book over as soon as I finished it, and when I got home (because remember, reading on airplanes&#8230; which also meant flight attendants asking if I was okay&#8230;), I started looking for fan art. I <em>needed </em>fan art.</p>
<p>What I found, instead, was an ebook. Courtney Stevens, you rock.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.courtneycstevens.com/novels/" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1208" src="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/blue-haired-boy-cover.jpg?w=640" alt="Blue-Haired-Boy-Cover"   /></a></p>
<p>THE BLUE-HAIRED BOY is Bodee&#8217;s story. It&#8217;s a prequel (can I call it that? It&#8217;s set before the  events of FAKING NORMAL. It&#8217;s extra information and BOY IS IT LOVELY), but both books are stand alone. You read one, you&#8217;ll want to read the other.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure which one I want you to read first. I would probably say, go with FAKING NORMAL and then read Bodee&#8217;s story, only because that way, you fall in love with Bodee in the order he was written. (Note that I have no idea if Courtney wrote TBHB first or second&#8230; but it&#8217;s listed second on her website, so I&#8217;m gonna stick with that order.) If you can&#8217;t stand sad books, then read TBHB first&#8230; and then you&#8217;ll be compelled to read FN, so whoops, sorry. Alexi and Bodee&#8230; they&#8217;re worth it.</p>
<p>I already wanted a boy like Bodee in my life, not even halfway through the story, but I <em>really </em>wanted one after the ebook. That&#8217;s a good story. Courtney has a way with words that I really appreciate and admire, and I spent most of the time reading both books wanting to hug the characters (and punch a couple. It&#8217;s not a high school book if you don&#8217;t want to punch someone).</p>
<p>The older I get, the weirder I find it to read books where the main characters are 16. I&#8217;ll continue doing so, don&#8217;t get me wrong, love me some YA novels&#8230; but I wasn&#8217;t like most of the characters in YA books. I didn&#8217;t drive, I didn&#8217;t really ride around with other 16 year olds that had cars, and I was home for dinner (almost) every night (shoutout to play practice). That said, the characters felt 16, but they didn&#8217;t feel childish. They didn&#8217;t feel fake. There were moments in FAKING NORMAL where I was like, yeah, this <em>is</em> what would happen in real life. (MINI SPOILER, but it&#8217;s on the back of the book&#8230; ) Bodee moves in with Alexi&#8217;s family. I won&#8217;t tell you why exactly, because that IS a spoiler, but it&#8217;s a logical move. Courtney sets it up so that it&#8217;s not a random thing &#8211; even less random if you read TBHB &#8211; and so I had no problem just going with it. Even after several days have gone by, it still seems like the very logical thing to happen.</p>
<p>I guess my point is, it&#8217;s not your typical high school book. Not even close. The problems they face are hard, and the emotions raw, and the situation real.</p>
<p>(Please note that I&#8217;m an emotional sap, so just because <em>I </em>cried doesn&#8217;t mean you will. Also, I cry at both happy AND sad. So just go with it. This book makes you feel things, which for me also equals tears.)</p>

		<p><em>This is the eighth and final post in my Chicago review series. If you want to read about the entire trip in order, check out the beginning post <a href="https://cassidynoga.wordpress.com/2016/01/12/reunited-chicago-review/">here</a>.  </em></p>
<hr />
<p>This is more a nod to a few products I tried in Chicago (that I haven&#8217;t seen elsewhere or hadn&#8217;t tried before), than it is a travel guide. This is how I travel&#8230; restaurants, sights, all that good stuff&#8230; and then GROCERY STORES! All the heart eyes.</p>
<p>The first is these Schar gluten free croissants. THEY ARE MADE WITH WHEAT &#8211; but it&#8217;s been processed to remove the gluten. They&#8217;ve been doing this in Europe for years, but the US is brand new to this gluten free wheat thing. I had zero reservations about trying these and zero problems. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1132" src="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_0434.jpg?w=640" alt="IMG_0434"   /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1133" src="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_0437.jpg?w=640" alt="IMG_0437"   /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1131" src="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_0436.jpg?w=640" alt="IMG_0436"   />You are TOTALLY supposed to put these on a cookie sheet&#8230; but I had a pizza tin. It worked. Let&#8217;s roll with it. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1129" src="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_0433.jpg?w=640" alt="IMG_0433"   /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1128" src="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_0435.jpg?w=640" alt="IMG_0435"   />You get four in each bag. I paid $4.49 (with a $2.50 savings!), so these puppies aren&#8217;t cheap. Seriously treat status right now, which is a shame. You have to keep them frozen &#8211; once thawed, they&#8217;re not to be re-frozen. Another bummer for only finding them on vacation; I couldn&#8217;t bring them home with me.</p>
<p>Prior to cooking, you have to let them thaw for an hour (!), and then bake for a few minutes. If I could get them at home, I would probably eat one at a time. They&#8217;re not SUPER TINY &#8211; but I also don&#8217;t eat a lot. Two would be my max, if eating with something else. As it was, I pretty much had cheese and bread. Good, but not super healthy. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1127" src="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_0440.jpg?w=640" alt="IMG_0440"   /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1130" src="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_0445.jpg?w=640" alt="IMG_0445"   />I think I&#8217;d give these 4.5 out of 5 stars &#8211; due to pricing, mostly. Taste is 5/5!</p>
<p>The second product is these hot pocket attempts. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1167" src="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_0390.jpg?w=640" alt="IMG_0390"   />These were $3.49 for a pack of two. Each was individually wrapped. Please ignore the fact that my finger got in the picture here. I wasn&#8217;t paying the most attention. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1166" src="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_0391.jpg?w=640" alt="IMG_0391"   />It specifically says not to use in a toaster oven&#8230; but I did. THOUGH, to be fair, my aunt&#8217;s toaster oven is not like a normal toaster oven. It&#8217;s like a mini oven&#8230; it preheats and all that jazz, and I think that&#8217;s kind of the point. Anyway. Behold&#8230; hot pocket thing. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1160" src="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_0394.jpg?w=640" alt="IMG_0394"   />They were alright. 3.5 out of 5 stars. They would have been better if they weren&#8217;t AS spicy. I&#8217;m not hugely sensitive to spice, but these were a little intense. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1159" src="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_0396.jpg?w=640" alt="IMG_0396"   /></p>
<p>Third product &#8211; Trader Joe&#8217;s pizza. My cousin and I had it at my grandfather&#8217;s house&#8230; his wife is sweet enough to make sure that I don&#8217;t starve when I visit them. (This goes for all of my family in Chicago. Seriously. So. Much. Food. <em>I love you all for it and a million other things.</em>) So my cousin and I did the thing with the oven and heated the pizza up. It wasn&#8217;t the best pizza ever, but it CERTAINLY wasn&#8217;t even close to the worst. I&#8217;m picky about my pizzas (one of these days, I&#8217;ll do a pizza post and just review all different kinds of pizza. Yum), so I&#8217;d probably give this 4 out of 5 stars. I&#8217;d buy/eat it again, and that should say something about how much I like it.  <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1158" src="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_0375.jpg?w=640" alt="IMG_0375"   />THESE. Okay let&#8217;s talk for a second. I am not a huge raspberry fan. I&#8217;ll eat them in smoothies but very rarely will I eat them by themselves as fruit. I didn&#8217;t buy these, and I wouldn&#8217;t have, but I will now. They were like mini ice cream/smoothie bars. I don&#8217;t know how else to describe them. They were GOOD, though. 5/5, though I think the would have been better with little stick handles. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1163" src="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_0376.jpg?w=640" alt="IMG_0376"   />Another thing I wouldn&#8217;t have bought on my own&#8230; but seriously, I wish I could get this stuff in Corpus. I really enjoyed it &#8211; my cousin commented on the sweetness (I can&#8217;t remember if she thought it was too sweet or not sweet enough, but everyone has different tastes). It&#8217;s good by itself, and it&#8217;s probably also good in smoothies. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1164" src="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_0380.jpg?w=640" alt="IMG_0380"   /></p>
<p>That&#8217;s all for my product roundup from the Chicago trip. I&#8217;ve got a couple more items coming soon &#8211; one of which I actually did try while up north, but I bought it on Amazon when I got home, so it&#8217;s not super exclusive. I&#8217;d like to start doing these a little more going forward, so let me know what you think about them. (: Or, of course, if there are products I should try!</p>

		<p><em>This is the seventh post in my Chicago review series. If you want to read about the entire trip in order, check out the beginning post <a href="https://cassidynoga.wordpress.com/2016/01/12/reunited-chicago-review/">here</a>.  </em></p>
<hr />
<p>I was very much still in bed when Paula called Thursday morning, asking if I wanted to do what we did a few years ago and go out to breakfast/brunch. I&#8217;m not one to give up pancakes, so even though I needed to shower and still wasn&#8217;t quite ready to leave the warm cocoon of my bed, I agreed.</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_1110" style="width: 5194px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1110" src="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_2061.jpg?w=640" alt="IMG_2061"   /><p class="wp-caption-text">August 2013, before knowing it had a GF menu</p></div>
<p>The Original Pancake House here in Chicago has caused some serious excitement on my part in the past. I took a picture of the sign once because I thought it looked cool (the one above). Then, almost year later, I was looking through old listserv posts and saw one about an OPH in like, Austin or something. I thought the name sounded familiar but I knew I hadn&#8217;t been there. After flipping through the pictures saved on my laptop, I found the picture of the sign. EXCITEMENT. The internet confirmed that they had gluten free pancakes, and now I knew where one was &#8211; and how to get there easily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div data-shortcode="caption" id="attachment_822" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-822" src="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_19063.jpg?w=640&#038;h=853" alt="IMG_1906"   /><p class="wp-caption-text">summer of 2014</p></div>
<p>So we went. It was great. The pancakes were great. I took a picture there that I use often for profile pictures &#8211; even the one on this website (as I type this&#8230; by the time I post it, things may be different). Then Meagan and I went to one in California. It wasn&#8217;t quite the same &#8211; I realized later that in Chicago, I had gotten half an order of pancakes, which meant I could eat them all and it wasn&#8217;t too expensive. California, however, didn&#8217;t have that option, and I ended up taking like four pancakes with me and then didn&#8217;t eat them later.</p>
<div style="width: 2260px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_0405-1.jpg?w=2250&#038;h=3000" alt="" width="2250" height="3000" /><p class="wp-caption-text">January 2016</p></div>
<p>Still, <em>pancakes</em>. I showered and bundled up, because winter in Chicago means it&#8217;s basically a frigid, frozen wasteland (but one that I just happen to love, so it gets a pass), and I have to wear more layers than I ever want to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div style="width: 2458px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img src="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_0408.jpg?w=2448&#038;h=2448" alt="" width="2448" height="2448" /><p class="wp-caption-text">January 2016</p></div>
<p>The OPH we go to is in Park Ridge (aka Uptown&#8230; off of N Northwest Hwy between Ridge Terrace and Euclid Ave). Here&#8217;s the deal. When we went in 2014, they used Bob&#8217;s Red Mill to make the pancakes/waffles. Now, they switched to a mix that uses popped Amaranth. It&#8217;s definitely not the same taste. If you like ancient grains, you&#8217;ll love these. If you don&#8217;t&#8230; well&#8230; you might not. I thought they were alright, but I liked the old ones better (to be fair, I&#8217;m more used to the old ones). We got to try them in both pancake and waffle form, because I make friends with everyone and the owner of the location had actually created the new mix.<a href="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_0448.jpg"><img src="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_0448.jpg?w=640" alt="" /></a><br />
I got hot chocolate to start. The waitress actually brought the box out for me so I could double check that it was gluten free. I always regret getting coffee because I&#8217;m such a picky coffee drinker, so I figured that I&#8217;d try something different. It was a great choice for a cold day. (Okay, actually it was like 41 today, which didn&#8217;t feel cold AT ALL after the last few days. Sigh.)<a href="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_0407.jpg"><img src="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_0407.jpg?w=640" alt="" /></a><br />
We both got the Basic Egg Combo &#8211; I got an over-easy egg (I REMEMBERED!), 3 pancakes, and hash browns, and Paula got a poached egg (and regular, gluten-filled pancakes). It was good, don&#8217;t get me wrong. Paula&#8217;s and mine together &#8211; plus the $1.50 uncharge for gluten free, and her coffee and my hot chocolate &#8211; was $23. <a href="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_0414.jpg"><img src="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_0414.jpg?w=640" alt="" /></a><br />
I do have to say, in the interest of full disclosure, that I much preferred the OPH meal we had a year and a half ago&#8230; and both experiences were topped by the Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe meal from earlier in the trip. The next time I&#8217;m back in town, we&#8217;ll certainly go back to the Original Pancake House, but I think if the menu stays the same, I might skip the pancakes.</p>
<p>Note &#8211; compare the pancakes above to the ones below, which are from the previous visit. They both look like pancakes, but the textures and thickness are different. That said&#8230; the new ones are probably healthier. I&#8217;ll let you be your own judge on that one. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-818" src="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_1909.jpg?w=640" alt="IMG_1909"   /></p>

		<p><em>This is the sixth post in my Chicago review series. If you want to read about the entire trip in order, check out the beginning post <a href="https://cassidynoga.wordpress.com/2016/01/12/reunited-chicago-review/">here</a>.  </em></p>
<hr />
<p>After we got donuts, we went back to Meg&#8217;s place for a second, and then went ice skating. It did not go so well for my twin. We decided to go to the lessons the following day &#8211; meaning I would be taking the El back downtown. No big.</p>
<p>So we set out for Millennium Park. On the way, we passed the lions in front of the Art Institute. We listened to the North Lion (the one at the back of this picture) before, so we stopped to listen to the South Lion. They&#8217;re both so great. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1061" src="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_0287.jpg?w=640" alt="IMG_0287"   />See the blue sign in this picture? That&#8217;s the sign for the statues that talk. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1062" src="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_0288.jpg?w=640" alt="IMG_0288"   />This sign was just amusing. Meg and I both pet the lion. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1056" src="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_0289.jpg?w=640" alt="IMG_0289"   />Photo op while the ice was being resurfaced (aka Zamboned).  <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1060" src="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_0292.jpg?w=640" alt="IMG_0292"   />The rink as we were leaving&#8230; <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1063" src="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_0295.jpg?w=640" alt="IMG_0295"   />From the ice rink, we got Starbucks (I think. Honestly it&#8217;s getting a little hard to keep track of all the times we got Starbs because we were so cold) and then went back to Meg&#8217;s for leftover breakfast sausages and then headed to the Metra station for the lovely trip into the suburbs where my grandmother lives. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1055" src="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_0298.jpg?w=640" alt="IMG_0298"   /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1057" src="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_0299.jpg?w=640" alt="IMG_0299"   />So we took the Metra, my cousin picked us up in Park Ridge (uptown!), and the three of us got Chipotle. I&#8217;m not destined to be a food blogger, apparently, because I didn&#8217;t even stop to take a picture. It was very good (but I still prefer Freebirds), but we were pretty hungry. We took Meg back to the El station (adventure!) and then off to grandma&#8217;s house we go.</p>
<p>The next morning, I bundled up and took the El into the city. I&#8217;d made that trip before, so I was on the watch for a particular graffiti spot. It&#8217;s just past the California stop. See the otters (?) that are almost hidden behind the white vans? <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1059" src="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_0302.jpg?w=640" alt="IMG_0302"   />The picture below is the one I took a few years ago. I&#8217;m so excited that it&#8217;s still there.</p>
<p>[old picture]</p>
<p>Then it was ice skating lessons time! More accurately, it was &#8220;it&#8217;s raining downtown and I&#8217;m either getting sick or my allergies are kicking my butt&#8221;, so I stopped into a Walgreens on my way to meet up with Meg at the rink. One purchase of cough drops and Zyrtec D later, and I was on my way to Millennium Park.</p>
<p>It was so cool to just get off the El and walk. I figured out where I was going, I met up with my best friend, and I realized that I probably should have taken an umbrella, because the wind isn&#8217;t as rough on them in the city as it is in Corpus.</p>
<p>Still, the rain pretty much stopped by the time the lesson started. Due to it, though, there weren&#8217;t many of us there. That was GREAT, because we were able to learn a LOT OF STUFF. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1058" src="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_0308.jpg?w=640" alt="IMG_0308"   />I definitely plan on taking lessons as soon as I move somewhere that actually, you know, has lessons.</p>
<p>After the lesson ended, we went to get a couple quick tourist shots of the Bean&#8230;  <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1068" src="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_5626.jpg?w=640" alt="IMG_5626"   /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1070" src="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_5628.jpg?w=640" alt="IMG_5628"   /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1069" src="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_5629.jpg?w=640" alt="IMG_5629"   />&#8230;including one by a nice visitor that took three pictures of us, but only one with our feet&#8230;<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1064" src="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_0315.jpg?w=640" alt="IMG_0315"   /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1066" src="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_0320.jpg?w=640" alt="IMG_0320"   />&#8230;and then it was off to meet Meg&#8217;s boyf for lunch! <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1065" src="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_0323.jpg?w=640" alt="IMG_0323"   />Red Robin! The place was T I N Y &#8211; we actually moved around a couple times, trying to get a bigger table. I first asked if they had gluten free buns, and the cashier said YES but then explained that they DO gluten free, but not actual buns. They do the lettuce buns instead. Fair enough. I got that (though note to self, I prob should just get the burger and eat it with a fork. I&#8217;m bad at burgers) and fries, and it was good! <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1067" src="https://cassidynoga.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/img_0324.jpg?w=640" alt="IMG_0324"   />I love having options downtown. While we didn&#8217;t go all out, we have plans to do a little more exploring &#8211; El riding and walking farther than the river and maybe even a Metra trip to cute suburbs &#8211; in THE SUMMER, when it&#8217;s WARM.</p>
<p>But even still, there are lots of places to safely eat in downtown Chicago. What are your favorites? Let me know! I&#8217;ll always have reasons to go to the city, and I love options.</p>
