	<h3>Bible Study</h3>
<p>Last year, I purposed to memorize 52 verses. I made a plan, wrote out fresh 3x5s, and got to it. Near the end of the year, I was feeling a bit…wandering. You know that feeling? Like you pull out your Bible and sit down with your coffee and just &#8212; BLANK. But you know what? God wants to speak to me. He wants me to hear His voice. He wants to strengthen me according to His Word. The inspiration may ebb and flow, but taking in truth is never in vain. </p>
<p>All that to say, in November, when I read <a href="http://briettapaladin.blogspot.com/2014/11/photo-dump.html">this post</a> by my sister, something about it was <i>alive</i> to me. I took that as the Holy Spirit speaking, and those verses became my study plan. I wrote them down in several versions. I chewed on each part. I determined to not just gloss over super-familiar verbiage and instead leave no rock unturned in my search for <i>food</i>. It really was the Lord speaking to me!</p>
<p>Since then, I&#8217;ve done a few short reading programs using YouVersion&#8217;s app on my phone. I bought a cheap composition notebook and have been copying down verses I&#8217;m memorizing and meditating on (besides my usual journaling, which is just a <i>must</i> in my life!) I&#8217;ve kept several different Bible translations at my fingertips, eager to hear familiar passages in new ways. God has been speaking. </p>
<h3>MuTu</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned here before that after Fiona&#8217;s birth, a nagging issue of diastasis recti became impossible to ignore &#8212; or, at least, detrimental to ignore. I have no idea how long the problem had been growing, but after her delivery, it was painfully obvious that my muscles were no longer doing their job of protecting and holding my insides. It was time for a game plan.</p>
<p>For four solid months, beginning immediately after her birth, I began following a <a href="https://diastasisrehab.com">program</a> developed by Julie Tupler. I wrapped my stomach day and night and faithfully did the best I could do check off my daily exercise. The awareness and strength I developed during those four months was very significant. The simple tips she gave &#8212; how to get out of bed, how to stand, how to simply <i>breathe</i> &#8212; in ways that would help and not hurt me were extremely valuable. </p>
<p>Four months later, having done the same thing day in and day out with not much change in sight, I decided to try out another program that my friends had begun, <a href="http://www.mutumamas.com">MuTu</a>. </p>
<p>For anyone suffering from a very severe diastasis recti, I would highly recommend beginning with Tupler. It is gentle, it is <i>clear</i>, and it is healing in a very deep, steady way (in my personal experience; I have absolutely no professional expertise!) However, beginning MuTu was just what I needed to keep me on the straight and narrow: variety, activity, and consolidated to one chunk of time each day. Some of the exercises I skip, because thanks to Tupler, I could immediately sense too much strain on my connective tissue. I went through MuTu&#8217;s 12 week program and finished last spring. Throughout the summer, I kept up a bit of exercise each day, although I fell completely off the wagon in August, due to our lives&#8217; busyness. No worries: the beginning of a new school year meant finding a new place for my 30-40 minutes of exercise to fit, and it&#8217;s been working since. I feel strong and I know that starting the morning with a high-intensity workout means more energy for the rest of the day. </p>
<h3>Vitamins!</h3>
<p>At the end of the summer, articles started flying around the internet about super-flus and viral epidemics. I was glad for the reminder to beef up our vitamin intake! I asked a friend for some recommendations, and we&#8217;ve been taking<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017O75VK/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&#038;psc=1"> Vitamin C</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003CT36NO/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&#038;psc=1">Vitamin D</a>, and a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GWG8FS/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&#038;psc=1">probiotic </a>each morning (with extra C as needed for a boost!) This past week, a few kids were down with a fever, so it certainly isn&#8217;t a guarantee for no sickness (but then, nothing is!)</p>
<h3>Reading</h3>
<p>I finally made myself <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/danicadunphey/books-to-read-this-year/">a reading list</a> for the year. I have until September to complete it, and I&#8217;m way behind, but I&#8217;m more on track than I would have been! I like to read. But it takes effort. Half the effort, for me, is just having a book to read! So far, lots of books not listed have made their way into my chair-side stack, but I&#8217;ve crossed off a few. My favorite read in a very long time? <a href="http://www.amazon.com/John-Adams-David-McCullough/dp/0743223136/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1423083423&#038;sr=1-1&#038;keywords=john+adams+by+david+mccullough">John Adams.</a> Fascinating. Challenging. Inspiring. </p>
<p>What are some of your favorite books?</p>
<h3>Netflix</h3>
<p>And the only reason more books aren&#8217;t crossed off is because I&#8217;m also completely into<br />
tp://www.cbs.com/shows/blue_bloods/&#8221;>Blue Bloods. I&#8217;ve skipped a few episodes here and there, due to content I wasn&#8217;t digging, but for the most part, I really enjoy this show. I like the characters and stories and just the strong Dad and family vibe. Yay for a portrayal of men who love integrity.</p>
<p>(You know I write this with fear and trepidation. Because, of course, after telling the world I like this show, you just watch &#8212; it&#8217;s going to all take a dive and turn into something I&#8217;m embarrassed to have ever seen. Ha!)</p>
<h3>Easy Cleaning</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/e-cloth-Starter-Pack-5-Piece/dp/B0009K6M8U/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1423083628&#038;sr=8-3&#038;keywords=e+cloths">E-cloths</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Norwex-Basic-Antibacterial-Microfiber-Package/dp/B003G4ZO4Y/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1423083643&#038;sr=8-1&#038;keywords=norwex+cleaning+products">Norwex enviro-cloths</a>: pretty much the only thing I use anymore for anything. Throw in a toilet brush and vacuum cleaner, and you&#8217;ve pretty much summed up my entire cleaning arsenal. Stains on carpets, fingerprints on glass, grease on stovetop, grime on walls… So simple and easy. And not dangerous. However, I did finally try out my friend <a href="http://reneeockrin-anockrinoccasion.blogspot.com">Renee&#8217;s</a> dish wand trick for the shower, and I&#8217;m a convert. Dawn dish soap, white vinegar, and tada &#8212; you can scrub your shower while taking a shower. Works for me! </p>

		<p><img src="http://dunphey.com/wp-content/themes/2007/images/jnd.jpg" style="float:left; margin-right:8px"/>Yup, my name is Danica. Like the race car driver, whose name I know, but whose career I know nothing about. A Nascar fan I am not. Things like reading, playing piano, gardening, cooking, sewing, writing, and keeping my bathroom bleached are more up my alley. <a id="y">Read more &raquo;</a><span id="x">My maiden name is Sinclair (not Patrick), and I come from good stock. (So says my husband, anyway!) I&#8217;m the oldest of 9 kids&#8211;and my parents are neither insane, uninformed, or Catholic. They&#8217;re actually the best parents you could ask for. Seriously. (And, consequently, I think pretty highly of my siblings, too, whose blogs you can access from the links below.) I&#8217;ve joined a new clan, though, and my husband and I have been &#8220;leaving-and-cleaving&#8221; for 2 years and counting. We have a son who you&#8217;ll read much (too much?) about. Oh. And there are pictures of him, too&#8211;hundreds of them&#8211;should you care to click on over to my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dunphey">flickr account</a>. I&#8217;m a stay at home mom who is redefining that title&#8211;I literally stay at home as much as I possibly can. I love to be home! Home, by the way, is in Northern California, although my roots are in a lil&#8217; ol&#8217; town in Northern New York. Lastly, I take all blame for any ridiculous, outlandish, illogical posts. Anything worth commenting on or linking to is due to my husband&#8217;s encouragement. In the spirit of the Little engine That Could, &#8220;He thinks I can, He thinks I can, He thinks I can,&#8230;&#8221;, and sometimes, that&#8217;s all a wife needs.</span></p>
